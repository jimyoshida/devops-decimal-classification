_work in progress._

## Timeline

🩵 Conway's law is an adage that states organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. It is named after the computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967.

💚 Development of the GNU operating system was initiated by Richard Stallman while he worked at MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was called the GNU Project, and was publicly announced on September 27, 1983.

💚 X/Open group was a consortium founded by several European UNIX systems manufacturers in 1984 to identify and promote open standards in the field of information technology.

💚 The GNU Manifesto is a call-to-action by Richard Stallman encouraging participation and support of the GNU Project's goal in developing the GNU free computer operating system.
The GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985.

💚 The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting free software development.

🩵 Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.
Introduced: Late August, 1988

💚 The Open Software Foundation (OSF) was a not-for-profit industry consortium for creating an open standard for an implementation of the operating system Unix. It was formed in 1988.

💚 CTAN (an acronym for "Comprehensive TeX Archive Network") is the authoritative place where TeX related material and software can be found for download.
CTAN was built in 1992, by Rainer Schöpf and Joachim Schrod in Germany, Sebastian Rahtz in the UK, and George Greenwade in the U.S.
CTAN was officially announced at the EuroTeX conference at Aston University, 1993. The WEB server itself is maintained by Gerd Neugebauer.

💚 CPAN was conceived in 1993 and has been active online since October 1995. It is based on the CTAN model and began as a place to unify the structure of scattered Perl archives.
On October 26, 1995, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) was established as a repository for the Perl language and Perl modules.

💚 The Open Group is a global consortium that seeks to "enable the achievement of business objectives" by developing "open, vendor-neutral technology standards and certifications." It was established in 1996 when X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation.

💚 The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary (abbreviated CatB) is an essay, and later a book, by Eric S. Raymond on software engineering methods.
The essay was first presented by the author at the Linux Kongress on May 27, 1997 in Würzburg (Germany) and was published as the second chapter of the same‑titled book in 1999.

💚 The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is an American nonprofit corporation to support a number of open source software projects. The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the Apache HTTP Server, and incorporated on March 25, 1999.

🩵 Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
Kent Beck developed extreme programming during his work.
He began to refine the development methodology used in the project and wrote a book on the methodology (Extreme Programming Explained, published in October 1999).

💚 SourceForge, founded in 1999 by VA Software, was the first provider of a centralized location for free and open-source software developers to control and manage software development and offering this service without charge.

💚 The Linux Foundation (LF) is a non-profit technology consortium founded in 2000 as a merger between Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group to standardize Linux, support its growth, and promote its commercial adoption.

🩵 On February 11-13, 2001, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and try to find common ground—and of course, to eat.
Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

🩵 CruiseControl is a Java-based framework for a continuous build process.
CruiseControl is free, open-source software, distributed under a BSD-style license. It was one of the first of its kind of software.
Initial release: March 30, 2001

💚 The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPI and also known as the Cheese Shop, is the official third-party software repository for Python.
PEP 241, a proposal to standardize metadata for indexes, was finalized in March 2001. A proposal to create a comprehensive centralised catalog was later finalized in November 2002.
Launched: 2003

💚 RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries.
Development on RubyGems started in November 2003 and was released to the public on March 14, 2004, or Pi Day 2004.

🩵 Hudson is a discontinued continuous integration (CI) tool written in Java, which runs in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat or the GlassFish application server.
Hudson became a popular alternative to CruiseControl and other open-source build servers in 2008.
Initial release: 1.0 / 7 February 2005

💚 Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.

🩵 DevOps as a term originated in 2009 following a talk at the O’Reilly Velocity Conference titled “10+ Deploys per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr.” John Allspaw and Paul Hammond walked through some of the pains in the current software development lifecycle.

🩵 In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois.

🩵 Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.
The Jenkins project was originally named Hudson, and was renamed in 2011 after a dispute with Oracle.
Initial release: 2 February 2011

💚 From 2012, Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).

💚 In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.

💚 On February 8, 2021, the formation of the Rust Foundation was announced by its five founding companies (AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla).
