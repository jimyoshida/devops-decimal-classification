# Self-taught DevOps

Welcome to this site, a comprehensive collection of essential concepts, useful technologies, and techniques curated specifically for DevOps engineers.
While the _continuous delivery_ becomes a core portion of the DevOps practices, it will require a broader range of knowledge to make flexible, low-cost, low-stress, and profitable systems.
Thus, this site assembles all such relevant domains - BizDataMLDevSecOps.

In addition, to understand the background of the technologies etc., each section contains the timeline of those items.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

The contents consist of the following 6 major classes, and they are classified like [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) system.

- [Class 000 - Agile, management, and general works](ch0/README.md)
- [Class 100 - Programming](ch1/README.md)
- [Class 200 - OS, network, and infrastructure](ch2/README.md)
- [Class 300 - WWW and applications](ch3/README.md)
- [Class 400 - Security and privacy](ch4/README.md)
- [Class 500 - Data, ML, and LLM](ch5/README.md)

## Motivations

- I want a curation list which contains multiple programming language cultures
- I want a curation list which covers all key techs used in today's dynamic web systems

## Backlogs

- Make the docusaurus site and host it
- Reconsider about the license
- Add brief explanations on each section and item
- Make a document of how to use the Makefile
