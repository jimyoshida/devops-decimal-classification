# Self-taught DevOps

Welcome to this site, a comprehensive collection of essential concepts, useful technologies, and techniques curated specifically for DevOps engineers.

While the continuous delivery becomes a focal point within the DevOps practice, it will require a broader range of knowledge to develop and operate truly effective systems.
Thus, this site assembles all such relevant domains - BizDataMLDevSecOps.

Also, to understand the background of the technologies etc., each section contains the timeline of them. The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

## Contents

The contents consist of the following 6 classes.
