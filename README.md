# Self-taught DevOps

Welcome to this site, a comprehensive collection of essential concepts, useful technologies, and techniques curated specifically for DevOps engineers.

While the continuous delivery becomes a focal point within the DevOps practice, it will require a broader range of knowledge to develop and operate truly effective systems.
Thus, this site assembles all such relevant domains - BizDataMLDevSecOps.

Also, to understand the background of the technologies etc., each section contains the timeline of them. The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

The contents consist of the following 6 major classes.

- [Class 000 - Agile, management, and general works](ch0/README.md)
- [Class 100 - Programming](ch1/README.md)
- [Class 200 - OS, network, and infrastructure](ch2/README.md)
- [Class 300 - Web and applications](ch3/README.md)
- [Class 400 - Security and privacy](ch4/README.md)
- [Class 500 - Database, AI, and ML](ch5/README.md)
