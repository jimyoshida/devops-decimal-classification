# Self-taught DevOps

Welcome to this site, a comprehensive collection of essential concepts, useful technologies, and techniques curated specifically for DevOps engineers.

While the continuous delivery becomes a focal point within the DevOps practice, designing a truly efficient system to drive continuous improvement requires a broader range of knowledge.
So, this collection contains all such relevant items for learning.

Also, to understand the background of the technologies etc., each section contains the timeline of them. The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.
