# Class C History

_Under restructuring._

## 1940s

In computer programming, assembly language is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work.

## 1950s

Regular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular events.

Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use.
John McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Lisp First appeared: 1958

## 1970s

C is a middle-level, general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.
C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.
C First appeared: 1972

sed ("stream editor") is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language. It was designed and created in part for educational use.
Smalltalk was the product of research led by Alan Kay at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).
The first Smalltalk programming system (called Smalltalk-72) ran on a Xerox Alto and was designed to support Alan Kay's new programming paradigm called object-oriented programming. [Ref](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Smalltalk_Programming/History)

AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
AWK was initially developed in 1977 by Alfred Aho (author of egrep), Peter J. Weinberger (who worked on tiny relational databases), and Brian Kernighan.

TeX is a typesetting system which was designed and written by Donald Knuth and first released in 1978.
The first version of TeX, called TeX78, was written in the SAIL programming language to run on a PDP-10 under Stanford's WAITS operating system.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as K&R, served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "K&R C".

## 1980s

Smalltalk-80 was the first language variant made available outside of PARC, first as Smalltalk-80 Version 1, given to a small number of firms and universities.

TeX82, a new version of TeX rewritten from scratch, was published in 1982. Among other changes, the original hyphenation algorithm was replaced by a new algorithm written by Frank Liang.
Since the source code of TeX is essentially in the public domain, other programmers are allowed to improve the system, but are required to use another name to distribute the modified TeX, meaning that the source code can still evolve.

TeX has been the official typesetting package for the GNU operating system since 1984.

C++ is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards.
C++ First appeared: 1985

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems.
When it was first released in 1987 by Richard Stallman, GCC 1.0 was named the GNU C Compiler since it only handled the C programming language.
GCC was first released March 22, 1987, available by FTP from MIT.

Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. "Perl" refers to Perl 5.
Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.

In 1998, the Microsoft Outlook Web Access team developed the concept behind the XMLHttpRequest scripting object.
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API in the form of an object whose methods transfer data between a web browser and a web server. The object is provided by the browser's JavaScript environment.

Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities.
