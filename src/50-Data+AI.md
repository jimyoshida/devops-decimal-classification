# Class E: Data and AI

This section lists AI/ML and LLM technologies.
They can help teams to work more efficiently, improve the software quolity, and respond to issues more quickly and effectively.
For example, they can assist developers in writing code more quickly and accurately.
This can save time and increase productivity, allowing teams to deliver software more quickly and with higher quality.
Also, they can be used to automatically detect and classify incidents in software systems, and even suggest solutions or automatically resolve issues.
This can help teams to resolve incidents more quickly and with less manual effort.
