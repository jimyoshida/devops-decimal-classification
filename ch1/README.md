## History

### 1940s

📜 In computer programming, assembly language is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work.

### 1950s

📜 Regular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular events.

📜 Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use.
John McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
First appeared: 1958

### 1960s

📜 Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard.
Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and featured garbage collection.  
First appeared: 1962

📜 Conway's law is an adage that states organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. It is named after the computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967.

📜 ed is a line editor for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
The ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating system — assembler, editor, and shell — developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&T Bell Labs.

### 1970s

📜 C is a middle-level, general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.
C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.
First appeared: 1972

📜 Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language. It was designed and created in part for educational use.
Smalltalk was the product of research led by Alan Kay at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).
The first Smalltalk programming system (called Smalltalk-72) ran on a Xerox Alto and was designed to support Alan Kay's new programming paradigm called object-oriented programming. [Ref](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Smalltalk_Programming/History)

📜 sed ("stream editor") is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs

📜 Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
Make First appeared: April 1976

📜 vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system.
The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley.

📜 AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
AWK was initially developed in 1977 by Alfred Aho (author of egrep), Peter J. Weinberger (who worked on tiny relational databases), and Brian Kernighan.

📜 Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978.
According to Joy, many of the ideas in this visual mode were taken from Bravo—the bimodal text editor developed at Xerox PARC for the Alto.

📜 TeX is a typesetting system which was designed and written by Donald Knuth and first released in 1978.
The first version of TeX, called TeX78, was written in the SAIL programming language to run on a PDP-10 under Stanford's WAITS operating system.

📜 In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as K&R, served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "K&R C".

📜 The Bourne shell, sh, was a new Unix shell by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs. Distributed as the shell for UNIX Version 7 in 1979

### 1980s

📜 Smalltalk-80 was the first language variant made available outside of PARC, first as Smalltalk-80 Version 1, given to a small number of firms and universities.

📜 Revision Control System (RCS) is an early implementation of a version control system (VCS). It is a set of UNIX commands that allow multiple users to develop and maintain program code or documents.
RCS was first released in 1982 by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University. RCS is currently maintained by the GNU Project.

📜 TeX82, a new version of TeX rewritten from scratch, was published in 1982. Among other changes, the original hyphenation algorithm was replaced by a new algorithm written by Frank Liang.

📜 TeX has been the official typesetting package for the GNU operating system since 1984.

📜 GNU Emacs is a free software text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman, based on the Emacs editor developed for Unix operating systems.
GNU Emacs is written in C and provides Emacs Lisp, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985.

📜 C++ is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards.
First appeared: 1985

📜 GDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system, after his GNU Emacs was "reasonably stable". GDB is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Initial release: 1986

📜 The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems.
